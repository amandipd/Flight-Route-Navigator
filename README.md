# Flight Route Navigator

### Status: In-Progress

In this project, I implemented a flight route planning program in Java, leveraging Dijkstra's Algorithm to minimize travel distances between airports. It efficiently handles datasets of 19,000+ airports and 40,000+ flight connections using graph traversal techniques. 

Currently, I'm working on deploying my application on the web and implementing an interactive map interface. This interface will allow users to zoom in and out, enabling them to select their starting and destination airports directly from a map rather than typing them in.
